Milestone 4 : "It's Pain Time"

Date: 2022-03-02

Number of Hours: 20 mins

**Overview**

My group and I got together for our weekly meeting to look over our project's current progress and to let every member present their task progress over the break. We not only updated each member, but we also provided feedback with what they can continuously work on and fix/change. After discussing the progress, we decided what our next steps will be for the upcoming work week, and what each members task for the week will be. Additionally, we updated our Jira board and created a new Milestone document.

**Challenges**

We struggled with our time management. A lot of us underestimated the break's length, along with our other assignments and midterms, and are falling behind on our planned tasks. This caused many of us to be confused on what everyone's next step will be and where our current project stands within the Jira timeline.

**Successes**

We reviewed everyone's pre-planned tasks and future goals using our Jira board. We then discussed and decided what everyone should be doing and what they must complete by next week. Andrew and I will continue to block out the needed scenes, however, my focus will shift more towards the functionalities belonging to player and items since we've all decided that's a higher priority. Damla and Riya will continue to work on their modelling tasks, but also create drawings of the models they're doing to build a better understanding for every team member. We updated our Jira board after finalizing everyone's current state and weekly goals.
