Milestone Reflections - Riya Yallabandi

Milestone 8 : "We see the finish line!"

Date: 2022-04-05

Number of Hours: 1 hr

Overview

We utilised this meeting to go over our what everyone has been working on and what else needs to be completed before our final 
deliverable this week. For the next few days my task will focus on finding new models and importing them into the scenes, and find
appropriate music and sound effects. We also took a few minutes to update the trello.

Challenges

There aren't any major challenges but we have been doing some research on how to make animation easier. We also tried to find 
animal rigs online but there aren't a lot of free resources. 3 of the people including myself are sick, so it's a bit difficult
trying to get work done. But trying our best!

Successes 
We sucessfully have gotten this far in the project and we are really proud of where we are at and looking forward to seeing what we 
have for the final.
