Milestone 7 : "We did it!" 

Damla Durhan

**Date: 2022-03-22**

**Number of Hours: 20 mins**

**Overview**

Our team discussed the tasks that needs to be done for the week. We prioritized the tasks and decide which one should be completed first.
Tasks are assigned evenly between the team members. We discussed what needs to be done for this week to improve what we have for our project, 
and edited the Trello Board accordingly. 

**Challenges**

We were a bit stressed last week because we were not sure if we were going to be able to finish all of our tasks before the Beta Presentation due. We were not
able to get our Jira board back so we had to switch to Trello board. 

**Successes**

We successfully finished all the futures we want to add for our Beta Presentation. We created a new board on Trello and added our backlogs and task cards on it. 
We decided on what other extra futures we want to add and assigned the tasks between group members accordingly.
