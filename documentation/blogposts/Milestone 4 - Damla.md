Damla Durhan

Date: 2022-03-01

Number of Hours: 20 mins

**Overview**

Our team got together to discuss this weeks goal and tasks. We devided our tasks evenly to complete this week's sprint. We went through everyone's tasks for the last week and how much we accomplished our weekly goal. Then, we set up our goal for this week to continue our progress on the project. We started working on the base for coding and 3D modelling. While programmers started working on the basic functionalities, the modelers started skeching out the object that needs to be modelled.

**Challenges**

We had some issues with time management and keeping up with our tasks. Since we have a lot to cover and other assignments to do it is very challanging for us to be on our schedule. Furthermore, it is challanging to model 3D objects that are not easily found in our time and there are not a lot resources that depics the objects. 

**Successes**

For this week's taks, we were able to split our tasks evenly. We successfuly set our goal for the new week and keep working on the tasks we started in the previous week. We made sure that we communicated with each other properly to make sure that everyone is on the same page and knows what they need to finish for the next week. For the 3D modeling, we sketched out the objects to have a better understanding of what we are modelling on Maya.
