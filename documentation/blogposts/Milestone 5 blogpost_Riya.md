Milestone Reflections - Riya Yallabandi

Milestone 5 : "Going Down Hill"


Date: 2022-03-08

Number of Hours: 1 hour


Overview

We utilised this meeting to inform each other on our progress on our tasks and to 
offer each other feedback for a few minutes. We created new tasks and objectives, as
well as updating the Jira board. We set hard deadlines to make sure we get back on track
and have everything prepared before our next deliverable. We also prioritized certain models that
need to be done for the Beta Presentation.


Challenges

There weren't a lot of challenges during this meeting. We are still working on our time managment 
skills.

We successfuly added our tasks to jira and due to falling off track,
we made a good plan that'll help us get back on track.
