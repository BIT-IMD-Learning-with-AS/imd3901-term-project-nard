Overview

We utilised this meeting to go over our what everyone has been working on and what else needs to be completed before next weeks 
deliverable. For the next few days my task will focus on finding new models and importing them into the scenes. We also took
a few minutes to update the trello.

Challenges

There aren't any major challenges but we have been doing some research on how to make animation easier. We also tried to find 
animal rigs online but there aren't a lot of free resources.

Successes 
We sucessfully have an idea on what to expect for the next few days and how what we hope to have done for the final.
