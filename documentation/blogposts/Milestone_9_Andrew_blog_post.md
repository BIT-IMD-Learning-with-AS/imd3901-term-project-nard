## Milestone 8 : "We can see the finish line " ##
 - _Date: 2022-029-03_
 - _Number of Hours: 9-10

 ### Overview ###

 Coming into the final stretch, we are focused on getting all of the necessary things we can finished. Adding important assets, audio and making sure each scene
 is filled out.

 ### Challenges ###
 
 One of the biggest challenges we are running into is the demand that is placed on the browser from models. I will have to find ways to lessen the demand while
 still keeping the scene occupied.

 ### Successes ###
 
 Models are textured, we are implementing audio for extras.
