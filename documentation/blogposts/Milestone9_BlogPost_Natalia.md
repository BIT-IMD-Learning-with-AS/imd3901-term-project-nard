Milestone 9 : "We see the finish line!"

Date: 2022-04-6

Number of Hours: 1 hr

**Overview**

My group and I got together for our weekly meeting to talk about what we need for our final project, listing the important tasks and the xtra tasks. We updated our Trello board.

**Challenges**
We had to limit ourselves to what can be done with the small amount of time we have left. We wish we could do VR but we had to take that out as we're limited on time. There are a lot of other factors we had to remove which made us sad since we had a final vision. A lot of us had to intervene and hold our members back as they got too excited and were asking for too much.

**Successes**

We made a final list of necessities we need done before the due date. Completing these main tasks will give us the most viable product we'd be proud to hand in. Then we made a list of extra factors we can add once we finished the main ones, just to add that cherry-on-top if everything works out. Each member has their specific tasks and know a specific due date for when we need everything.
