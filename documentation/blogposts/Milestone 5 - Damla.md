Date: 2022-03-08

Number of Hours: 1 hr

**Overview**

Our team got together to discuss this weeks goal and tasks. We devided our tasks evenly to complete this week's sprint. We went through everyone's
tasks for the last week and how much we accomplished our weekly goal. Then, we set up our goal for this week to continue our progress on the project.
We decided to set our priorities for the upcoming beta presentation. We put our tasks into a lists and sorted them based on how importan they are. For coding,
the main focus will be doing the functionalities for picking the item up, putting it back and any other function related to interacting with the artifact. For 3D modelling,
creating the artifact will be the first priority, which are the moccasin and turtle rattle. 

**Challenges**

Like in the previous milestones, time management is our biggest issue. We had some small discussions to decide which tasks should be our priority. We have various tasks
that need to be done for the beta presentation and we want to make sure that we are covering the important features of our project before the deadline. Furthermore, it is
challenging to maintain the communication between each other and making sure that everyone is on the same page.

**Successes**

For this week, we set our priorities for our tasks and focus on the important parts of our project. We will be keep working on where we left off last week. We successfully
achieved to have a clear understanding of our goal for the week and made sure that every teammate knows what their tasks are.
