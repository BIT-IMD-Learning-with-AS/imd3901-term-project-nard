Damla Durhan

Date: 2022-04-05

Number of Hours: 1 hr

**Overview**

Our team discussed the tasks that needs to be done for the week. We prioritized the tasks and decide which one should be completed first.
Tasks are assigned evenly between the team members. We made a list of the tasks that need to be finished first and medium priority tasks. If we have more time,
we will be working on the extra functionalities that we would like to add in our project. 


**Challenges**

Like in every milestone, we were worried if our scope is realistic and achiavable. There are many functionalities that we would like to add. As a team, we had
a hard time to decide which tasks to focus on first and which tasks to do once we are done with our main tasks. Moreover, time management is one of our major issues to
overcome and completing the tasks on time is getting more stressful. 


**Successes**

Like we did in the last milestone,  we decided on prioritizing the important tasks to manage our time successfuly and completing a final product
that we are satisfied with. Everyone agreed on which tasks to be finished first and focusing on their parts. We have a solid plan to finish our tasks on time
in order to have a represantable product at the end.
