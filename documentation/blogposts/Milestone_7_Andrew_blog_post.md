## Milestone 6 : "After Beta" ##
 - _Date: 2022-022-03_
 - _Number of Hours: 10-12_

 ### Overview ###

 We submitted our beta presentation as of Friday, we made significant progress within our project. I was able to implement the blessing, an information feature and some
 assets to the pre-contact scene. We will continue to add models and textures while flushing out the story component through effects and audio. 
 Overall, I'd say we were successful.
 
 ### Challenges ###
 
 Things went pretty well but I think some of the challenges we faced were technical rather than probkem solving. I ran into issues exporting GLTF files from substance
 so I had to pass them off to Riya, as well there were some difficulties with loading in audio for certain elements.
 
 ### Successes ###
 
 We were very successful in adding new models with textures to populate the scene. I was able to add the "blessing" component in time as well which gives some more 
 interactivity.
 
 ### Next Milestone ###
 
 With this coming milestone, we will be just plugging away at adding more models: specifically people and animals. 
 
 Below is a current version of our project.
