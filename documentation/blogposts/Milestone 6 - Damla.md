Milestone 6 : "No Pain No Gain"
Damla Durhan

Date: 2022-03-15

Number of Hours: 1 hour

**Overview**

Our team discussed the tasks that needs to be done for the week. We prioritized the tasks and decide which one should be completed first. Tasks are assigned evenly between the
team members. We discussed what needs to be done for the Beta Presentation. We were not able to update our Jira Board because of an error.

**Challenges**

Time management is one of our bigest challenge through the project. We are a bit behind in our schedule than we expected. Furthermore, we were not able to access our Jira Board
beacuse of an issue that we are not sure of. We are hoping that it is a temporary issue that will be fixed. 

**Successes**

For modelling, me and Riya are almost done with modelling the artifacts we want to put in the scenes. Natalia is working on the functionality and Andrew is blocking the pre-contact
scene. We decided on a plan to be prepared for the Beta presentation. We made our schedule for the upcoming meetings and accomplish as much as possible.
