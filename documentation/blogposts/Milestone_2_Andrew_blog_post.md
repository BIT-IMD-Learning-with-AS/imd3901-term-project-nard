## Milestone 1 : "To Be or Not to Be" ##
 - _Date: 2022-08-01_
 - _Number of Hours: 3_

 ### Overview ###
 We mainly focused on organizing the project for the next two epics: 
 
 ## Proposal Document ##
 
 I will be responsible for:
    - High level development plan
    - Experience flow/ architecture
 
 ## Alpha presentation ##
 
 We need to work further on our proposal but we have some tickets made for the presentation. 
 
 ### Challenges ###
 
 Looking at the different regions of the proposal, we had some issues agreeing upon who gets what tasks and the direction of the beginning of the project
 
 ### Successes ###
 Everyone seems to understand how Jira works and knows their roles now.
