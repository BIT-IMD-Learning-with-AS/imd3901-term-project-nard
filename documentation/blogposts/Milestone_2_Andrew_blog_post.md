# Milestone Reflections - Andrew Holland #

## Milestone 1 : "Project plan" ##
 - _Date: 2022-08-01_
 - _Number of Hours: 3_

 ### Overview ###
 We mainly focused on organizing the project for the next two epics: 
 
 # Proposal Document #
 
 I will be responsible for:
    - High level development plan
    - Experience flow/ architecture
 
 # Alpha presentation #
 
 We need to work further on our proposal but we have some tickets made for the presentation. 
 
 ### Challenges ###
 
 Looking at the different regions of the proposal, we had some issues agreeing upon who gets what tasks and the direction of the beginning of the project
 
 ### Successes ###
 Everyone seems to understand how Jira works and knows their roles now. We have gotten some inspiration for our project from the pictures being sent by the fellow Algonquin students. The rattle below is an example of a cool item that could have a sound/ visual component to interact with.
