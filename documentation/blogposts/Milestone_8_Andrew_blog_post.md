## Milestone 8 : "Working on it... " ##
 - _Date: 2022-029-03_
 - _Number of Hours: 2-3_

 ### Overview ###
 
 Mainly research and adding of models, this week has been focused on bringing in elements that fill the story space with material.
 
 ### Challenges ###
 
 I've run into more challenges then I would've liked with trying to add animated characters. There are several issues since A-frame doesn't natively support the
 animation of rigs and posing character models isn't easy to do.
 
 ### Successes ###
 
 I was successful in finding character models that fit the scene in terms of accuracy, so now the audio I've put in will help to accomodate for a current lack of
 animation of the characters.
 
 Below is a screenshot of the character models I've added to the scene.
