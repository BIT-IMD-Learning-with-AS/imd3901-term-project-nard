Milestone 8 : "Working on it"

Date: 2022-03-29

Number of Hours: 30 mins

**Overview**

My group and I got together for our weekly meeting to decide what we'd like to have for our final product and what every member should work on throughout the week before our next team meeting. We made a list that focused on what models, functionalities, and ambiance factors we need. We updated our Trello board.

**Challenges**

We're drowning in other assignments from other classes so a lot of us aren't in the right mindset getting started on this project so we're a little behind on our planned timeline schedule.

**Successes**

We gave everyone a set of straight forward tasks that should be done or in the works by our next meeting. They're very specific allowing each member to clearly understand what they must do and figure out when to squeeze it inside their school schedule.
