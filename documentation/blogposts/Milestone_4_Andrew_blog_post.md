# Milestone Reflections - Andrew Holland #

## Milestone 4 : "Story & Planning" ##
 - _Date: 2022-01-03_
 - _Number of Hours: 3-4_

 ### Overview ###
 
 In the past milestone our team has been steadily working on the main story components. I personally have added the post-contact scene which I'll continue to work on.

 
 ### Challenges ###
 
 Some of the challenges we are having are surrounding the gathering of assets and just generally staying on top of the work to be done. Having the scene in a good condition
 and to the accuracy we wanted it may be a bit more challenging then I originally thought.
 
 ### Successes ###
 
 We do have success in terms of the work flow in Github. We are able to easily add new code and collaborate well.
 
 ### Next Milestone ###
 
 In the coming milestone, Damla and Riya will be model the assets, prioritizing the story objects first
 Natalia will be working away on the Artifact state to ensure that the main mechanics of the story work.
 I'll continue to block out the scenes and look at ways of implementing the critiques the students asked about (controlling the canoe, blessings etc..)

 Below is progress on the contact scene with a placeholder for the long house and a drying rack.
