# Milestone Reflections - Andrew Holland #

## Milestone 6 : "Lead up to beta" ##
 - _Date: 2022-01-03_
 - _Number of Hours: 4_

 ### Overview ###

 As we lead up to the beta presentation, we still have a lot of work to do. I have been able to gather a number of assets to be used in the scene and have started implementing
 functions for the user interactions with the environment.
 
 ### Challenges ###
 
 As a recurring theme, our challenges center around use of time since we have to spare the time to work on the project. We have also had difficulties using A-Frame since
 support and help online is very little and we are trailblazing solutions to certain graphics and function problems.
 
 ### Successes ###
 
 We have our more important models done to be used in the scenes for interaction, and we have a solid plan for this week leading up. We will be able to add important aspects 
 to the project to have it be more visually stimulating for the user.
 
 ### Next Milestone ###
 
 In lead up to next milestone, we will have a steady workflow of adding assets to the scene, choosing interactions and adding story components where they need to be.
 
 You will see the pre-contact scene as it is now
