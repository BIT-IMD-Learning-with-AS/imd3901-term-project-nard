Milestone 6 : "We did it!"

Date: 2022-03-22

Number of Hours: 20 mins

**Overview**

My group and I got together for our weekly meeting to see what our next big due date is and what we want to aim for. We each decided to set our tasks in the Trello board and to start working to at least have something to show for the next meeting.

**Challenges**

We have a lot of other assignment due dates coming up so a lot of our focuses were a little off today and not realizing we need to start the progress of this project as soon as possible.

**Successes**

We had a great Beta presentation and we were all really happy with eachother in this meeting. We managed to all get an understanding of where we are in the project timeline and where we're headed. We each understood our current tasks.
