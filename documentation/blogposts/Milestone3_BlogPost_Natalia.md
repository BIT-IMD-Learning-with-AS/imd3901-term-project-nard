Milestone 3 : "It's Game Time"

Date: 2022-02-15

Number of Hours: 60 mins

**Overview**

My group and I got together for our weekly meeting to look over our project's current progress. We decided what our next steps will be for our project after completing the alpha presentatoin and propposal document, and what each members task for the week will be. Additionally, we updated our Jira board and created a new Milestone document.

**Challenges**

We struggled with understanding what needs to be done for the project where we won't procrastinate until the Beta presentaion but we also won't set unfair expectations for the group's progress. On that note, we had difficulties deciding how much everyone should do for this week because sometimes we'd go overboard and other times we'd barley give someone any tasks.

**Successes**

We discussed and reviewed our planned schedule for every task we assigned to check whether it's do-able throughout the week or not. We went through each members task so we can all have a gist of where our overall project's progress should be by the end of the week. Riya and Damla went over which models they would like to add for pre-contact since they're the modellers. Andrew and I went over what we need to complete for the pre-contact scene and the level of detail we're aiming for. We decided a simple, blocking design just to have an understanding and base for the pre-contact scene before moving to the next one.
