# Milestone Reflections - Andrew Holland #

## Milestone 1 : "Story & Planning" ##
 - _Date: 2022-015-02_
 - _Number of Hours: 5-6_

 ### Overview ###
 
 Since last milestone, we handed in our proposal and alpha presentation. For this milestone our focus was on completing the story elements of our project.
 We have our story completed since we all agreed on having the artifact mechanic to engage when the user has left or entered a time period.
 
 Since I've got our milestones planned out, we can now make Jira tickets for each sprint. This makes work sharing much easier.
 
 ### Challenges ###
 
 The major challenge was juggling what needed to be done with work from other classes. This was worked out since we have dedicated time to work on the project.
 We weren't able to completely block out the first scene in time, but luckily we have the next sprint.
 
 ### Successes ###
 
 We were able to set up our project to work in Aframe. 
 As well, we have been able to make tickets for individual pieces of work.
 The story being completed means we know what the flow is.
 
 ### Next Milestone ###
 
 In the coming milestone, some of the team (Damla and Riya) will be designing assets, prioritizing the story objects first
 The other half of the team (Natalia and I) will be blocking out the scenes for the rest of the story. 

 Below is a picture of the prototype and the experience flow for the story.
