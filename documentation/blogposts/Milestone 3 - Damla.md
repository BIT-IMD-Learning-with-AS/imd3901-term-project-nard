Date: 2022-02-15

Number of Hours: 30 mins

**Overview**

Our team got together to discuss this weeks goal and tasks. We devided our

My group and I got together for our weekly meeting to look over the proposal document. We split the work evenly between all of us in order to efficiently complete 
the project before the due date. We also finalized our project idea and storyline, along with a few functionalities we'd like to focus on in our interactive system. 
Our overall goal was to understand the scope of our project so we can plan our future weekly goals.

**Challenges**

It was a challenge to understand the proposal documents requirments and to evenly split it between all members without being unfair or placing too much. 
It was also difficult finalizing an idea for our storyline since we're all very creative and opinionated. In addition, we kept going out of our scope due to getting 
too excited with ideas.

**Successes**

For our proposal document, we split the tasks based on our strengths. Riya and Damla are responsible for the designing parts of the documents, while Andrew and I 
have more of the technecality aspects of our project. This allows each individual to efficiently work on their tasks in a quick and proper manner. We also empahsized 
our scope and placed limitations in our users actions, allowing our ideas to land within our goal scope. We used the images provided from the Algonquin students, 
in the discord, to help us strive for a certain storyline and expereince. It also helped having members say their opinion on certain ideas and where our capabilities 
land like "I'm the main programmer and I can't do that" or "I'm the modeller and that's too many things to model". This allowed us to create a sturdy base for our project 
storyline and our user functionalities.
