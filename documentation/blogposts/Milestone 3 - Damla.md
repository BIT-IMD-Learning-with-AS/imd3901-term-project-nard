Damla Durhan

Date: 2022-02-15

Number of Hours: 60 mins

**Overview**

Our team got together to discuss this weeks goal and tasks. We devided our tasks evenly to complete this week's sprint. We finalize what we want to do with our project storyline, the 3D models we want to add to the pre-contact scene and finalized the functionalities. Our overall goal for this milestone was to create a fundamental base and decide on our scope for the first part of our story , which is the pre-contact times.

**Challenges**

It was challanging to decided what 3D Model needs to be in the pre-contact times. We had to do a little research to make sure that the 3D models we will be using are accurate items for the given time period. We had some discussions about what functionalities need to be included to our scope and how can we implement them. It was challanging to stay inside the scope

**Successes**

For this week's taks, we were able to split our tasks evenly and everyone is assigned with a task that they are comfortable with. This allows us to work efficiently
on the project. Furthermore, we made sure that no one did not get overwhelming or too basic tasks that they end up doing nothing for that week. We set our scope 
successfuly for the first part of the story keeping it managable for all of us.
