Milestone 5 : "Going Downhill"

Date: 2022-03-08

Number of Hours: 1 hour

**Overview**

My group and I got together for our weekly meeting to look over everyone's current progress with their tasks and the overall progress of our project. We realized we have been really behind from our planned timeline and decided to set hard deadlines on tasks that must be completed by the beta presentation. To really balance out our progress and not get off-track, we decided to create a modelling and functionality priority list. Each priority was discussed and finalized by the group. We also updated our Jira board and created a new Milestone document.

**Challenges**

We continue to struggle with our time management. Majority of us are behind on our tasks and are really confused on which models/functionalities we should focus. We don't know where to place our time and focus on so we can at least have an MVP product by the beta presentation. 

**Successes**

We created a priority list for both models and functionalities based off of our incompleted/behind tasks. We all left on our opinions and finalized our list as a group. This allowed us to really understand what we're aiming for by the beta presentation and what we have to complete. We managed to update our Jira board. We added more tasks to our sprints and edited our timeline.
