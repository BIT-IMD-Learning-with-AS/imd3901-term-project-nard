## Milestone 1 : "To Be or Not to Be" ##
 - _Date: 2022-02-01
 - _Number of Hours: 1

 ### Overview ###
My group and I got together to discuss our primary/secondary roles and an overal idea/gist of what our term project story will be.

 ### Challenges ###
We struggled with understanding the canoe story and picturing how we're going to lay it out. We realized there are a lot of components to the pre-created story.
Additionally, we had difficulties deciding the roles for our group since we had no idea what aspects/features are needed for our VR interactive story.

 ### Successes ###
We read over the story's PDF as a group and analyzed every section within the timeline story. We have an overall idea of what we'd like to do and will propose
the story modification to our Porf. and story creators at our next scrum meeting. Each individual assigned themselves a vague role that we will later on 
specify depending on our finalized project idea.
