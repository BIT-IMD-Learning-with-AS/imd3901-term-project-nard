Milestone Reflections - Riya Yallabandi

Milestone 6 : "No pain no gain"


Date: 2022-03-15

Number of Hours: 1 hour


Overview

We utilised this meeting to inform each other on our progress on our tasks and to 
offer each other feedback for a few minutes. We talked about our next major deliverable which is 
the beta presentaiton this Friday. We made a list of things that need to still be completed by then.
Unfortunately our Jira was deleted and we weren't able to add our tasks in for this week.


Challenges

Our biggest challenege was not having access to our Jira and we were also a little behind in modelling since
a lot of the object cannot be found on sketchfab.

Successes
We sucessfully have the main objects modelled for this friday's presentation. Natalia was able to 
Code a moving water effect which is super cool!
