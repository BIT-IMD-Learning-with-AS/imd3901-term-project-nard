Milestone Reflections - Riya Yallabandi

Milestone 7 : "We dit it!"


Date: 2022-03-22

Number of Hours: 20 minutes


Overview

We utilised this meeting to go over our next due dates and plan our next few tasks for the next deliverable.
We also went over what models we plan to include in the final. We assigned each other tasks and updated
the trello board


Challenges

There aren't any major challenges but finding specific models has been difficult since modelling them 
consumes a lot of time which we don't have.

Successes
We sucessfully finished our beta presentation and we are really happy about the way it turned out. We're hoping
the rest
