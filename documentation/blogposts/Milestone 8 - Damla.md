Number of Hours: 30 mins

**Overview**

Our team discussed the tasks that needs to be done for the week. We prioritized the tasks and decide which one should be completed first. Tasks are assigned evenly between the team members. We want to add more animated 3D models for animals and people around the environment. We will be adding an audio narration to the scene and other more functionalities that we would like to have in the final product. 


**Challenges**

We were a bit worried about our scope. We want to add more cool and different functionalities that makes us stand out from other teams that are working on the same story as us. Time management is one of our major issues to overcome and completing the tasks on time is getting more stressful. Moreover, we were worried that the scenes we have so far does not look natural and realistic enough. We want to add animated animals and people in the scenes. However, we are not sure how to implement it yet. 


**Successes**

We made a good task list on the Trello. We decided on prioritizing the important tasks to manage our time successfuly and completing a final product that we are satisfied with. We started adding more animals to the scenes to give the VR a more realistic and natural feeling. We are working on how to add animated 3D models to our scene at the moment.
