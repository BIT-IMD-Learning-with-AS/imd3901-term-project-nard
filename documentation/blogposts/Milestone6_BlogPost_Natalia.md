Milestone 6 : "No Pain No Gain"

Date: 2022-03-15

Number of Hours: 1 hour

**Overview**

My group and I got together for our weekly meeting to look over everyone's current progress with their tasks and the overall progress of our project. We went over what we'd like to have for our Beta Presentaiton this Friday and made a list. We organized the priorities and decided what every member will focus on. We tried updating our Jira Baord but somehow it's been deleted and we can't access it.

**Challenges**

We tried accessing our Jira Board but it was trashed and it's unaccessible now. We tried finding and retrieving it but we couldn't solve it, we messaged Anthony to see what we can do. We also realized how far behind we are with our project's progress. We're having trouble with getting the models we need for all our scenes and blocking out the scenes fully so we have something to show for the Beta presentation. 

**Successes**

A few of us made great progress with our tasks. I ended up getting the water effect to work out to bring that interactive realism to the experience. I also finalized the artifact selection rotation to bring that user interation. Damla and Riya are 80% completed their models for the artifacts. Andrew blocked out a lot for the pre-contact scene as well. We also got a solid plan for what we need and plan to have for the Beta presentation. We made a schedule to meet and complete as much as possible.
